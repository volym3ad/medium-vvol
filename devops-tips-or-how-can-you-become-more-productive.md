# DevOps tips or how can you become more productive?

Recently I have visited DevOpsDays that was first carrying out in Kiev, Ukraine. I must admit it was a tremendous experience for me, maybe the best event I have ever attended. There were awesome speakers, nice audience and chatty talks. I have outlined several best practices that can help me become better engineer than I am now =P

And sure thing I want to share these tips with folks)

## 3 main rules to do DevOps:

* **Communication**

Or you could also hear as **“Reduce Silos”**.

To my mind, communication is the most important part of DevOps culture. Without strong and healthy collaboration inside team you cannot boost your development. All your beginnings will be crashed by misunderstandings and lack of trust. Train your soft skills. If you’re on Lead position, you’ll need extra skills. I will necessarily write a separate story about this.

* **Do not fear to risk**

Or you could also hear as **“Embrace the Failure”**.

Often I hear phrases like: “Just don’t break something” or “I do not want to break sth so I won’t do any changes here” or “Ben is more knowledgeable about Elasticsearch, so I will assign this task to him” etc. Though it’s not an option. DevOps is about velocity and you can gain this only by accepting risk. Fail as fast as you can. Give a chance to new technologies, help Ben to have rest) This way you will increase your team’s bus factor.

* **Remove manual work**

Or you could also hear as **“Eliminate Toil”**.

Toil is all that manual repetitive work that take most of your work time. I think that task that you do more than once should be automated. This way you can free your time and spend it to long-term and more valuable goals. But do not over-engineer. You should first estimate severity/importance, complexity and duration. Maybe there is other crucial task that must be tackled immediately?

**P.S.** It’s not a full list though. I have identified main components that seems the most important for me. I’m always happy to hear feedback from you. Maybe there is something I forget about.

And the last thing I want to add:
> “Attend DevOpsDays — it’s awesome!”
